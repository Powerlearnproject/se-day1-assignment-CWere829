Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The key milestones in the evolution of Software Engineering include: 
i.)	The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The word "software engineering" was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This milestone highlighted the "software crisis", where software projects were failing due to poor planning, lack of structure, and increasing complexity. It led to the adoption of structured programming techniques and formal development methodologies.
ii.)	The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s-1980s)
The introduction of structured programming by Edsger Dijkstra promoted the use of control structures (loops, conditionals) instead of unstructured "goto" statements. The Waterfall Model, introduced by Winston W. Royce, became the first formalized software development lifecycle (SDLC), emphasizing sequential phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Programming languages like C and Pascal emerged, improving software efficiency and readability.
iii.)	The Agile Revolution (2001 - Present)
In response to the rigid and slow Waterfall approach, the Agile Manifesto was introduced in 2001 by a group of software developers. Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) promote iterative development, flexibility, and customer collaboration over rigid documentation. This milestone paved the way for DevOps, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and cloud computing, transforming how modern software is developed and maintained.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i.)	Requirement analysis involves identifying and gathering user needs, business objectives, and system requirements. It also, involves stakeholder discussions, feasibility studies, and documentation of functional and non-functional requirements.
ii.)	Planning is where the project scope, cost estimation, resource allocation, and risk assessment are well defined and a roadmap is created to guide the development process. 
iii.)	System design involves translating requirements into architectural designs, data flow diagrams, UI mockups, and system models. During this period hardware, software, database, and network specifications are established. 
iv.)	Implementation (Coding) is the phase of developing the actual source code using programming languages like Python, Java, or C++. The predefined design documents and coding standards form the basis for coding. 
v.)	Testing encompasses identifying and fixing defects to ensure the software meets quality standards. These tests include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). 
vi.)	Deployment is where the software is released to end users which could be done in phases or as full development. 
vii.)	Maintenance and support is the continuous updating and improving the software based on user feedback and changing requirements. This allows fixing bugs, enhancing security, and ensuring long-term software performance.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
i.) Approach: The Waterfall methodology follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next while the Agile methodology is iterative, flexible, and adaptive, allowing continuous improvements throughout development.
ii.) Phases: Waterfall consists of well-defined phases, including Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, and Deployment. Agile, on the other hand, operates through continuous cycles called Sprints or Iterations, where frequent reassessments and refinements take place.
iii.) Flexibility: Waterfall is rigid, with changes becoming costly and difficult after the initial planning stage. Agile, however, is highly adaptable, enabling modifications at any stage of the development process.
iv.) Customer Involvement: Customer feedback in Waterfall is limited to the initial requirements gathering and final delivery stages. Agile promotes continuous customer involvement, ensuring that feedback is incorporated throughout development.
v.) Delivery: In the Waterfall approach, the final software is delivered only after all development stages are complete. Agile delivers working software in small, incremental releases, allowing for ongoing improvements.
vi.) Testing: Waterfall conducts testing only after the development phase is complete, while Agile integrates testing into each sprint, ensuring ongoing quality assurance.
Scenarios of Application
Waterfall is best suited for:
•	Projects with clear and stable requirements, such as building a payroll system for a company.
•	Government or regulatory projects that require detailed documentation, such as financial reporting software.
•	Small, well-defined projects with minimal expected changes.
Agile is ideal for:
•	Fast-changing projects, such as mobile app development or AI-based software.
•	Customer-driven projects requiring frequent updates, such as e-commerce websites or SaaS platforms.
•	Startups and innovation-driven environments where flexibility is essential.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
i.) Software Developer: A software developer is responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining code to create functional and efficient software applications. They work based on design specifications provided by analysts or architects, ensuring that the software meets user requirements. Developers may specialize in different areas, such as front-end development (user interfaces), back-end development (server-side logic), or full-stack development (both front-end and back-end).  
ii.) Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: The QA Engineer ensures the software meets quality standards before it is deployed for users. They design and execute test cases to identify bugs, performance issues, or inconsistencies in the software. By conducting manual or automated testing, they help improve the reliability and functionality of applications, ensuring a smooth user experience. QA engineers collaborate closely with developers to fix defects and enhance software quality.  
iii.) Project Manager: The project manager oversees the entire software development process, ensuring that projects are completed on time, within budget, and according to specifications. They manage resources, assign tasks, track progress, and facilitate communication among stakeholders, including developers, testers, and clients. By coordinating efforts and mitigating risks, the project manager plays a crucial role in delivering successful software solutions. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
i.) Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): IDEs streamline coding by providing tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one platform, boosting efficiency and reducing errors. IDEs enhances productivity, maintainability, and teamwork in software development. Examples include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm. 
ii.) Version Control Systems (VCS): VCS tracks code changes, enables collaboration, and prevents data loss by maintaining a history of modifications. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts. VCS enhances productivity, maintainability, and teamwork in software development. Examples include Git, SVN, Mercurial.  

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i.)	Managing complex codebases

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
i.) Unit Testing focuses on testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation. It is usually performed by developers using automated testing frameworks such as JUnit (for Java) or pytest (for Python). It assists detect errors early in the development cycle, ensures each unit of code functions as expected and reduces debugging time by isolating issues in specific components.
ii.) Integration Testing verifies that multiple components or modules of a software system work together as intended. This step is necessary to check data flow between interconnected parts, such as APIs, databases, or third-party services. Its importance covers identifying issues in communication between modules, ensuring that integrated components function cohesively and helping prevent system failures due to mismatches between different software parts.
iii.) System Testing evaluates the entire software application as a whole to verify that it meets technical and functional requirements. It includes performance, security, and usability testing. It helps validate the complete system works as expected, detects defects related to the overall system behaviour and ensures compliance with business and technical specifications.
iv.) Acceptance Testing determines whether the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment. It is often conducted by end users or clients and includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Beta Testing. It is important to ensure the software meets real-world user needs, provides final approval before release and helps identify usability issues from an end-user perspective.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the approach and refinement of the elements that are fed into AI models in order to obtain relevant high-quality responses. It includes putting together phrases, using context clues, and fine-tuning word choice in order to achieve better results from interaction with AI.

Importance of Prompt Engineering in AI Interactions:
i.) Improves AI responses - AI models produce relevant answers with more precise detail to tailored crafted prompts.
ii.) Improves efficiency and productivity - correct initial understanding translates to having fewer revisions which increases productivity.
iii.) Tailoring AI answers for particular tasks - creating content, writing code, analyzing data, and providing customer service are tasks selected from a wide array of specialized functions.
iv.) Reduces ambiguity and bias - Clear coherent well-structured prompts prevent misinterpretations by all parties and allow for fairer balanced responses.
v.) Enables broader applications in different industries - In healthcare, finance, and education, AI-derived solutions and decisions can easily be refined.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a Vague Prompt: Tell me about technology.
